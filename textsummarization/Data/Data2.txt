Mr Tillerson has been at odds with Mr Trump over foreign policy recently. The secretary of state was even reported to have privately described the president as a moron. They have differed in their approach to North Korea's missile testing and Iran's nuclear programme, among other issues. But the White House has said Mr Tillerson continues in office and the state department said the rumours were not true. The reports emerged initially in the New York Times and Vanity Fair, quoting government sources. Associated Press quotes two unnamed White House officials as saying a plan is being discussed. Mr Pompeo would be replaced at the CIA by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, the New York Times reports.
