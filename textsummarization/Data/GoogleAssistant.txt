Assistant is the latest refinement of Google's virtual assistant technology. Much like Siri you can use it to launch apps, send messages, search the web, and answer questions. Until recently it was only available on the Pixel range of smartphones, along with a select few flagship Android handsets. But at Google I/O, which took place over 17th-19th May 2017, Google announced that the app was now available on the iPhone, bringing it directly into competition with Siri. While it was initially US-only, the Google Assistant app is now available to download in the UK too. Of course Apple's own assistant has a distinct advantage over the newcomer as it is able to access far more parts of the system than the Google variant, mainly because it's actually baked into iOS.
